| Layer            | Technology                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Presentation     | ASP.NET MVC, Razor Views, Tailwind CSS  |

## üìê Architecture

This project follows an **N-Tier** architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Handles HTTP requests, renders views, and interacts with client-side scripts.
2. **Business Layer**: Contains application logic, services, and validation.
3. **Data Layer**: Manages database context and migrations with Entity Framework Core.

Each layer is organized in its own project namespace:
```
- Clickly.Presentation (ASP.NET MVC)
- Clickly.Services    (Services)
- Clickly.ServiceContracts    (Interfaces)
- Clickly.Data        (DbContext, Migrations)
```

## üíæ Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/) (for Tailwind CLI)
- SQL Server, MySQL, or an alternative supported by EF Core
